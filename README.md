Data Warehouse Prototype Project
Download Data

We will be exploring Lending Clubâ€™s loan origination data from 2007-2015. Please download the dataset in CSV format (loan.csv) and associated dictionary (LCDataDictionary.xlsx) from https://www.kaggle.com/wendykan/lending-club-loan-data.

Part 1: Data Exploration and Evaluation

Create an exploratory data analysis project. Load the data and perform any necessary cleaning and aggregations to explore and better understand the dataset

Part 2: Data Pipeline Engineering

Please build a prototype of a production data pipeline that will feed an analysis system (data warehouse) based on this dataset. This system will allow data scientists and data analysts to interactively query and explore the data, and will also be used for machine learning model training and evaluation. Assume that the system will receive periodic updates of this dataset over time, and that these updates will need to be processed in a robust, efficient way.

For this section, please:

    Create a data model / schema in a database or storage engine of your choice
    Develop code that will persist the dataset into this storage system
    Include any data validation routines that you think may be necessary
    Use your choice of geospatial python package and create spatial analysis
        Loan.csv file has addr_state. Please aggregate loan data for states and visualize it.

Prioritize simplicity in your data model and processing code. Explain your thought process.


Mechanics

Use the tools, programming languages and frameworks that you are most comfortable with. We primarily use Jupyter, Python and SQL, but this is not a requirement.

Submit all code and documentation via GitHub. Please include all code files, outputs, and visualizations in the repository. Do not include any passwords or secrets in your code. Include a documentation file with your project. Please assume that your work will be shared with data engineers as well as data scientists and software engineers in a collaborative environment.
